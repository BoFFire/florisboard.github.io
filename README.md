# FlorisBoard Website

This repo contains all the necessary config files, assets, layouts and the actual content of the [FlorisBoard website](https://florisboard.org).

This website is built using the static website framework [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), without any external themes installed.

The resulting webpage is entirely static (HTML/CSS only, no server-side code) and deployed to the GitHub Pages environment automatically.

## Building the website locally

1. [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
2. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
3. Run `hugo server`
4. Open http://localhost:1313/ in your browser

## Plans for the future

- Translation
- Better landing page contents (in accordance with the planned app store entry branding rework)
- Improve colors of the theme
